THESE ARE THE STEPS HOW TO COLLABORATE(MEMBERS) ON SAME PROJECT

                       >>>>>>[MAIN LEADER]<<<<<<

1.main bnda project ka folder bna ka initial files bnata ha 
2.then wo in sab ko add karta ha github pa with help of commands in terminal
3.add karta han collaborators

                    >>>>>>>>>[COLLABORATER WORK]<<<<<<<<

after collaborators accepting invitation [go to vscode and make a separate folder and run this in terminal (1.git clone url(project link)) and they see all the initial files in folder now before adding single line of code collaborator make a personal branch for creating branch you type these lines in terminal(2.git checkout <branch/name> e.g----> git checkout mybranch) ].
so now collaborator clone the project in own machine and also  creates own branch
[VERY IMPORTANT]collaborator apna code usi branch ma lekhega na ka main branch ma after completing code
collaborator us ko add kare ga commit kar ka push kar de ga yad rahe push bhi apni branch krni ha e.g(git push -u origin mybranch). 
ab main bnda fetch kare ga aur merge kr de ga

                    MAIN LEADER WORK
>after completion collaborator work main bnda fetch kare ga for fetching run this commmand in terminal (1.git fetch) after fetching you see all the new  branches added by the collaborator
>now you go the collaborator branch and see the changes/additional code from collaborator for moving u use (1.git checkout/switch mybranch) and after viewing u can reject or accepting work 
>in case of accepting u go on main branch and then run (1.git merge <collaborator branch name) after merge u see all changes in main branch now after it you push this on github (2.git push origin main)
now new code is on github and on main person machine now new code is not in collaborator machine they have its own chnages so 
                    [COLLABORATER WORK]
>after accepting collaborator code by leader now collaborator go in main branch open terminal and run this cmd(1.git fetch) and (2.git pull)
